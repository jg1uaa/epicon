### What is serial communication software epicon?

- epicon is a Linux serial communication software.

- In practice IOT House uses the thermo-hygrometer AM2320 sensor and AI/DIO for control with TOCOS TWE-Lite via serial communication from the USB connection ToCoStick of Raspberry Pi & IOT-House_old_pc(i386 PC).
- I think that network devices such as Switch and Router that can be configured with serial ports and console PCs can be used regardless of manufacturer or model.
- When automating the settings, Cisco Switch and Router copy and paste the text data created in advance and fill in the config.
  At this time, it is important to send delay of characters and line breaks to prevent the config data from being missed.
- epicon supports the transmission delay of important characters and line breaks as this serial console, and you can copy and paste the config with confidence.
- In addition, file transfer software such as simple telnet and zmodem, shell, macro, start of external software, etc. CUI, but it is multifunctional and compact.

  - Switch settings and options available (/dev/ttyUSB0,19200bps, character delay:30ms, CR delay:50ms) In my old experience, setting this delay will not cause the config to be missed.
```
# epicon -d 30 -D 50 -s 19200 -l /dev/ttyUSB0

NAME
       epicon  is  Easy Personal Interface Console terminal software.  First I
       am sorry. Because my English linguistic power is very shabby, this sen‚Äê
       tence  is being translated by the machine.  Because of that, read it in
       the interpretation which it is tolerant of though it thinks that it  is
       a little funny translation.

SYNOPSIS
